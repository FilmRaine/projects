Union: 
Everyone
wing-ding
They
weren't
type
So
they
went
on
train
bridge
Where
weather
howling
And
oh
my
When
comes
rolling
No
paper
thin
walls
no
folks
above
one
else
can
hear
The
crazy
cries
love
were
laughing
dancing
knew
their
strong
heard
far
off
whistle
hoping
going
to
be
long
Cuz
In
back
booth
an
all
cafe
Two
dripping
raincoats
are
hanging
Outside
shade
streetlight
clanging
smile
ear
eye
Ice
cream
melting
piece
pie
Oh
Every
kiss
sweet
touch
totally
tandem
As
come
a-rumbling
sang
lover's
song
wild
abandon
It
was
a
dark
and
stormy
night
the
rain
fell
in
torrents-except
at
occasional
intervals
when
it
checked
by
violent
gust
of
wind
which
swept
up
streets
for
is
London
that
our
scene
lies
rattling
along
housetops
fiercely
agitating
scanty
flame
lamps
struggled
against
darkness

Intersection: 
It
was
a
dark
and
stormy
night
the
rain
in
at
it
by
of
up
is
